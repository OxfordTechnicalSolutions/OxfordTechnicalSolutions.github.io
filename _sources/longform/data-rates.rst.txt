Data Rates
##########

A key question when providing aiding to any sensor fusion algorithm is: what 
data rate will produce the best results?

Generally speaking, the ideal rate for an OxTS INS to receive data from an 
aiding source will lie in the range of 1-10Hz. GNSS receivers like those found 
in OxTS devices typically output in this range, and they are excellent sources 
of aiding.
