Advanced commands
#################

Advanced commands are options that can be set on the INS to allow different 
functionality or change the behaviour of the INS. They are set in the mobile.cfg file which can be found by
using FTP to a device.

The easiest way to set these advanced commands is on the Commands tab inside the Advanced Tools page in NAVconfig. 
NAVconfig is available for Windows as part of NAVsuite, which is OxTS' proprietary suite of applications for configuring and interacting with OxTS devices.
It is downloadable from the OxTS website https://support.oxts.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000789105-NAVsuite
